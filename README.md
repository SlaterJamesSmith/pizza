## Description

_A simple form that will calculate the cost of a single pizza purchase based on pie size and number of toppings._

#### Program behavior specifications:
* _The program will return unique pricing for pizza based on user input when the "calculate cost" button is clicked._
* _If the user asks for a small pizza with zero toppings, the program returns the lowest possible cost of $10._
* _The user can choose zero to four toppings, each costing an extra $2. For example, a small pizza with two toppings will return $14 ($10 small pizza + two toppings at $2 each)._
* _The user must choose one of four sizes. For each sequentially larger size, price increases by $3. For example, a medium pizza with three toppings will return $19 ($10 + $3 for a medium pizza + three toppings at $2 each) and an extra large pizza with no toppings will also return $19 ($10 + $3 + $3 + $3 for an extra large pizza + $0 in toppings)._
* _The program returns an additional $2 in cost for each topping selected._
