## Description

_A simple form that will calculate the cost of a single pizza purchase based on pie size and number of toppings._

#### Program behavior specifications:
* _The program will return unique pricing for pizza based on the user's input to the form whenever the "calculate cost" button is clicked._
  * _Example input: click "calculate cost" button_
  * _Example output: "Your pizza will be $19."_
* _If the user asks for a small pizza with zero toppings, the program returns the lowest possible cost of $10._
  * _Example input: select "Small" in form and click "calculate cost" button_
  * _Example output: "Your small pizza will be $10."_
* _The user can select zero to four toppings. For each topping the user selects, the program will add an extra $2 to pizza price._
  * _Example input: select "Small" in form, and check "Extra Cheese" and "Anchovies" options, then click "calculate cost" button_
  * _Example output: "Your small pizza with extra cheese and anchovies will be $14."_
* _The user must choose one of four sizes. For each sequentially larger size above our $10 small pizza, price will increase by $3, plus $2 for each selected topping._
  * _Example input: select "Large" in form, and check "Extra Cheese" and "Anchovies" options, then click "calculate cost" button._
  * _Example output: "Your large pizza with extra cheese and anchovies will be $20."_
* _The user may run the application as many times as s/he likes. It will erase the last message, and return a new output based on the new form inputs._
  * _Example input 1: click "calculate cost" button_
  * _Example output 1: "Your extra large pizza will be $19."_
  * _Example input 2: select "Large" in form, and check "Extra Cheese" and "Anchovies" options, then click "calculate cost" button._
  * _Example output 2: "Your large pizza with extra cheese and anchovies will be $20."_
